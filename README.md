# How to get started
*You must have Ruby and Node installed before you can begin.*

1. Get the repo.
2. Open a command window in the root of the repo.
3. Install Gulp `npm install --global gulp`.
4. Install Jekyll `gem install jekyll`. (*You may need to install the appropriate [Ruby Devkit](http://rubyinstaller.org/downloads) before you can run Jekyll. [See here](https://github.com/oneclick/rubyinstaller/wiki/Development-Kit) for installation instructions.*)
5. Install Jekyll Sitemap `gem install jekyll-sitemap`.
6. Install Jekyll Redirect From `gem install jekyll-redirect-from`.
7. Install Node packages `npm install`.
8. Run Jekyll `jekyll serve`.
9. Launch your favorite browser and navigate to `localhost:4000`.

If you want to make any modifications to the styles, make sure you have Sass installed. Running `gulp` will auto-run the Jekyll server, compile your styles, and watch for changes.
