title: I'm going to do this. Finally.
---

I’m going to start writing. I’ve been saying this for far too long, but this time I’m doing something about it.

In the past, I always found an excuse not to write:

- I’m not good enough
- I don’t know what to write about
- I’m too tired
- I don’t feel motivated
- There’s not enough time
- Nobody cares about what I have to say
- Etc.

Even though I knew writing would only help me in the long run, I still didn’t do it. Honestly, I think the biggest excuse for me was that it’s just too tough to find the motivation to write.

My full-time job tends to suck the energy right out of me. I’m on a computer at least 8--10 hours a day and typically the last thing I want to do is go home and get right back on. I find myself too exhausted to do much more than eat dinner, hang out with the wife, and watch some Netflix.

So, why am I doing this now? Why is this time different? Perhaps I’m just fed up with the whole situation. The fleeting motivation, the internal struggle, the guilt...it isn’t healthy to beat yourself up over anything like this and I’ve been doing it for years now.

I want to learn how to communicate more effectively. I want to teach people what I know. I want to shed a light on who I am and where my values lie. Above all, I just want to learn and grow as a person. What better way to achieve these goals than to just start writing?

So here I am at the end of my first post and I gotta say, it’s a lot easier than I expected. I just had to sit down and do it.
